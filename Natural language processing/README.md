### Skills checklist

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam will test you on this set of skills.

4.  Natural language processing (NLP)

    You need to understand how to use neural networks to solve natural language processing problemsusing TensorFlow. You need to know how to:

    - Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
    - Prepare text to use in TensorFlow models.
    - Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using binary categorization
    - Build models that identify the category of a piece of text using multi-class categorization
      TensorFlow Certificate Candidate Handbook 3
    - Use word embeddings in your TensorFlow model. - Use LSTMs in your model to classify text for either binary or multi-class categorization.
    - Add RNN and GRU layers to your model.
    - Use RNNS, LSTMs, GRUs and CNNs in models that work with text.
    - Train LSTMs on existing text to generate text (such as songs and poetry)
