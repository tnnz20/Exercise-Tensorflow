### Skills checklist

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam will test you on this set of skills.

2.  Building and training neural network models using TensorFlow `2.x`

    You need to understand the foundational principles of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) using TensorFlow 2.x. You need to know how to:

    - Use TensorFlow 2.x. - Build, compile and train machine learning (ML) models using TensorFlow.
    - Preprocess data to get it ready for use in a model.
    - Use models to predict results.
    - Build sequential models with multiple layers.

    - Build and train models for binary classification.
    - Build and train models for multi-class categorization.
    - Plot loss and accuracy of a trained model.
    - Identify strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.
    - Use pretrained models (transfer learning).
    - Extract features from pre-trained models.
    - Ensure that inputs to a model are in the correct shape.
    - Ensure that you can match test data to the input shape of a neural network.
    - Ensure you can match output data of a neural network to specified input shape for test data.
    - Understand batch loading of data.
    - Use callbacks to trigger the end of training cycles.
    - Use datasets from different sources.
    - Use datasets in different formats, including json and csv.
    - Use datasets from tf.data.datasets.

3.  Image classification

    You need to understand how to build image recognition and object detection models with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow `2.x`. You need to know how to:

    - Define Convolutional neural networks with Conv2D and pooling layers.
    - Build and train models to process real-world image datasets.
    - Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network.
    - Use real-world images in different shapes and sizes..
    - Use image augmentation to prevent overfitting.
    - Use ImageDataGenerator.
    - Understand how ImageDataGenerator labels images based on the directory structure.
