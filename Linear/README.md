### Skills checklist

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam will test you on this set of skills.

1.  TensorFlow developer skills

    You need to demonstrate that you understand how to develop software programs using TensorFlow and
    that you can find the information you need to work as an ML practitioner. You need to:

    - Know how to program in Python, resolve Python issues, and compile and run Python programs
      in PyCharm.
    - Know how to find information about TensorFlow APIs, including how to find guides and API
      references on tensorflow.org.
    - Know how to debug, investigate, and solve error messages from the TensorFlow API.
    - Know how to search beyond tensorflow.org, as and when necessary, to solve your TensorFlow
      questions.
    - Know how to create ML models using TensorFlow where the model size is reasonable for the
      problem being solved.
    - Know how to save ML models and check the model file size.
    - Understand the compatibility discrepancies between different versions of TensorFlow.
