### Skills checklist

The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam will test you on this set of skills.

5.  Time series, sequences and predictions

    You need to understand how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow. You need to know how to:

    - Train, tune and use time series, sequence and prediction models.
    - Train models to predict values for both univariate and multivariate time series.
    - Prepare data for time series learning.
    - Understand Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and how it can be used to evaluate accuracy of
      sequence models.
    - Use RNNs and CNNs for time series, sequence and forecasting models.
    - Identify when to use trailing versus centred windows.
    - Use TensorFlow for forecasting.
    - Prepare features and labels.
    - Identify and compensate for sequence bias.
    - Adjust the learning rate dynamically in time series, sequence and prediction models.
